# 🧠 Data Mining - Course Project

This repository contains practical exercises and final project notebooks for the **Data Mining** course. The goal is to apply core data mining techniques to real-world datasets using Python.

## 📚 Contents

The repository is organized into multiple topics in data mining:

| 📁 Notebook Name        | 📝 Topic                             | ✅ Status |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|
| `Clustering.ipynb`     | K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering     | ✅ Done   |
| `Classification.ipynb` | Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN    | ✅ Done   |
| `Association.ipynb`    | Association Rules (Apriori, FP-Growth)| ✅ Done   |
| `Regression.ipynb`     | Linear & Polynomial Regression       | ✅ Done   |
| `Dimensionality.ipynb` | PCA, t-SNE                           | ✅ Done   |
| `Preprocessing.ipynb`  | Data Cleaning, Encoding, Scaling     | ✅ Done   |

> All notebooks include visualizations, performance metrics, and code explanations.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Understand and implement key data mining techniques.
- Apply algorithms to structured datasets (CSV, Excel).
- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.
- Use Python libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `mlxtend`, and `seaborn`.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quynhphuong1209/Data-mining.git
cd Data-mining
```
2. Install dependencies (using pip or conda):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, run directly on Google Colab if you don't want to install anything locally.
3. Open any notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Clustering.ipynb
```
# 📦 Requirements
